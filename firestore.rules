/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ParkSmart Reserve application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a combination of user-based access control for user profiles and public read access with owner-only writes for parking slots, reservations, violations, and feedback.
 * All write operations are strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, secured with owner-only access.
 * - /parkingSlots/{parkingSlotId}: Stores parking slot data with public read access and open writes.
 * - /reservations/{reservationId}: Stores reservation data with public read access and open writes.
 * - /violations/{violationId}: Stores violation data with public read access and open writes.
 * - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Stores user feedback with public read access and open writes.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - The rules prioritize secure write operations and flexible data shapes for rapid prototyping.
 * - Public read access is granted to parking slots, reservations, violations, and feedback.
