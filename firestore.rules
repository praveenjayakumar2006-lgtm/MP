/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ParkSmart Reserve application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a combination of user-based access control for user profiles and reservations.
 * It allows any authenticated user to create feedback and violations, and allows any authenticated user
 * (including the owner) to read from those collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, secured with owner-only access.
 * - /parkingSlots/{parkingSlotId}: Publicly readable, not writable by clients.
 * - /reservations/{reservationId}: Owned by the user who created it.
 * - /violations/{violationId}: Writable by any authenticated user, readable by any authenticated user.
 * - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Writable by any authenticated user, readable by any authenticated user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles and reservations.
 * - The owner role is handled by the application logic, and the rules grant read access to authenticated users,
 *   which implicitly includes the owner for viewing all feedback, violations, and bookings.
