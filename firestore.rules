/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ParkSmart Reserve.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection and ensures that users can only
 * manage their own resources, with public read access to parking slot information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, secured by user ID.
 * - /parkingSlots/{parkingSlotId}: Contains publicly accessible parking slot data.
 * - /reservations/{reservationId}: Stores reservation data, secured to the reserving user.
 * - /violations/{violationId}: Stores parking violation data.
 * - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Stores user feedback data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user documents.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Parking slot data is publicly readable but not writable by clients.
 * - Reservations are secured to the user that made the reservation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'Reservation' entity includes a 'userId' field to directly associate
 * reservations with users, enabling simple ownership checks without requiring
 * additional reads.
